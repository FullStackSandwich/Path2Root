Enumeration:

Found two ports using nmap
22 ssh
80 http

Used gobuster to directory bust the webserver, found out drupal version 7.6

Initial shell:

Used drupalgeddon2 to get a foothold
Then curl a reverse shell php code to upgrade shell a little bit


Privilege Escalation:
As web root/apache, I curl'd linpeas.sh to find a username and password combination for mysql. 
Alternatively, using grep could also find strings of password in the files and reveal the same thing.

mysql -u drupaluser --password=CQHEy@9M*m23gBVj -e "use drupal; show tables; SELECT * FROM user"

The mysql command needed to be a one-liner due to the limited tty shell I was in. 
I was able to get a salted hash, which happens to be a hash for drupal7.

Cracking the hash:
hashcat -m 7900 -a 0 '$DgL2gjv6ZtxBo6CdqZEyJuBphBmrCqIV6W97.oOsUf1xAhaadURt' rockyou.txt
-->> booboo is the password

cat /etc/passwd reveals user as brucetherealadmin

Shell as brucetherealadmin:
sudo -l 
Sudo -l reveals that /usr/bin/snap install can be run without root passwd

instead of COMMAND=id, i reconfigured it to COMMAND='cat /root/root.txt'

ez double flag
